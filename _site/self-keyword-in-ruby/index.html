    "body": "2025/05/22 -  Setting up Vite with Rails 8 and React: A Complete Setup GuideIn this guide, we’ll go step by step from creating a new Rails app to rendering a simple “Hello from React” text in the browser using Vite for frontend tooling. Prerequisites: Before diving into setting up Vite with Rails and React, ensure your system has the following tools installed. These are essential to create and run the application smoothly. 1. Ruby (Version 3. 1 or higher recommended): Ruby is the core language for Rails. You can check your installed version using: ruby -vIf Ruby is not installed, consider using a version manager like rbenv or rvm to manage versions: brew install rbenvrbenv install 3. 2. 2rbenv global 3. 2. 22. Rails (Version 7. 1 or higher recommended): Rails is the web framework we’ll be using. Make sure it’s installed: gem install railsConfirm the installation with: rails -v3. Node. js (Version 18+ required by Vite): Vite requires a recent version of Node (v18 or newer). You can check the current version: node -vIf you’re not on the right version, use nvm to manage Node versions easily. nvm allows you to switch between multiple Node. js versions easily. This is useful if you’re working on multiple projects with different requirements. Install nvm: curl -o- https://raw. githubusercontent. com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0. 39. 7/install. sh | bashReload your shell (. zshrc, . bashrc, or . bash_profile), then install Node 18: nvm install 18nvm use 184. Yarn (Package Manager for Node): Yarn is used to manage JavaScript dependencies like React and Vite plugins. Install it via Homebrew (on macOS): brew install yarnVerify the installation: yarn -v5. PostgreSQL (or another preferred DB): Rails supports several databases, but PostgreSQL is widely used in production. You can install it in simple steps using postgresapp. com Ensure it’s running correctly: psql --versionYou may also use SQLite (the Rails default), but PostgreSQL is recommended for most setups. Step-by-Step Setup: 1. Create a New Rails 8 App with Vite: rails new vite-rails-app --javascript vitecd vite-rails-appThis sets up your Rails app with Vite instead of the default import maps or Webpacker. 2. Add React to Your Project: Install React and ReactDOM using Yarn: yarn add react react-domSet Up React with Vite: 3. Update vite. config. ts: Edit vite. config. ts to enable JSX support and React plugin: import { defineConfig } from 'vite'import RubyPlugin from 'vite-plugin-ruby'import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'export default defineConfig({ plugins: [  RubyPlugin({   additionalEntrypoints: ['**/*. jsx'],  }),  react(), ], server: {  port: 3001 }})Set Up Rails View and Controller: 4. Generate a Controller: rails generate controller Welcome indexThis creates a WelcomeController with an index action and view. 5. Set Root Route: Edit config/routes. rb: root  welcome#index Create React Entry Point: 6. Create app. jsx: Create the file: app/frontend/entrypoints/app. jsx import React from  react import ReactDOM from  react-dom/client const App = () =&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello from React!&lt;/h1&gt;const root = document. getElementById( root )if (root) { ReactDOM. createRoot(root). render(&lt;App /&gt;)} ⚠️ Ensure the file has a . jsx extension so Vite can parse it correctly. Update Rails View to Load React: Edit app/views/welcome/index. html. erb: &lt;%= vite_client_tag %&gt;&lt;%= vite_javascript_tag 'app' %&gt;&lt;div id= root &gt;&lt;/div&gt;This sets up the HTML and loads your React component inside the #root div. Run the App: 7. Start Rails and Vite Dev Servers: In one terminal, run: bin/rails serverIn a second terminal, run: bin/vite devVisit http://localhost:3000 — you should see: Hello from React!Issues you might face -: @vitejs/plugin-react can't detect preamble:  Ensure you’re using . jsx extension.  Verify correct entrypoint name in vite_javascript_tag. File not found in manifests:  Double-check file is inside app/frontend/entrypoints.  File extension should be . jsx. Summary: You now have:  A Rails 8 app React integrated via Vite Working React component rendered from a Rails viewThis setup gives you the best of both worlds: Rails’ robust backend and Vite’s lightning-fast front-end tooling.

    "title": "Database Partitioning by Example",
    "body": "2024/08/02 -  As name suggests it is way of dividing database table into smaller parts generally called as partitions. Partitioning logic can vary from use case to use case. For example, we might partition users table based on ID i. e. IDs from 1 to 1,000,000 will be in first partition, IDs from 1,000,001 to 2,000,000 would be second one and like this. Another example would be based on created date, for example - All entries from 2020 would go in one partition, entries from 2021 would go in another one and so on. When?: It is fair to ask when to partition table in first place. The straight forward answer would be when table data grows to a fairly large size and querying on it becomes slow and painful for database, we should look into aspect of partitioning the table. Benefits of partitioning -: As we are dividing table into smaller chunks, searching of data becomes relatively faster. Also in Postgres, database is smart enough to only look into particular partitions based on logic in where clause. Also maintenance operations like vacuuming are performed on relatively small and updated datasets. A bit about our use case -We have product_views table which stores information about views received on products across the platform. Over the time and by the nature of data, this table grew to a size of 20 GB, having over 50 million rows. The querying of data from this table was now relatively slow (even though we have proper indices maintained for this table) and it was sheerly because of volume of data. So what do we do now? Looking into data and size we decided to partition this table.   Here is how we achieved it. Our tech stack is backend powered by Ruby on rails and Postgres database. We wanted to do it with minimal changes on rails part and more on Postgres part. Postgres supports partitioning from version 11 onwards. We divided the table by created_at column yearwise. A postgresql script to create partition is - CREATE TABLE orders (  id SERIAL,  order_date DATE NOT NULL,  customer_id INTEGER,  amount DECIMAL(10, 2)) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);CREATE TABLE orders_2019 PARTITION OF orders  FOR VALUES FROM ('2019-01-01') TO ('2020-01-01');CREATE TABLE orders_2020 PARTITION OF orders  FOR VALUES FROM ('2020-01-01') TO ('2021-01-01');CREATE TABLE orders_2021 PARTITION OF orders  FOR VALUES FROM ('2021-01-01') TO ('2022-01-01');  CREATE TABLE orders_2022 PARTITION OF orders  FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-01-01') TO ('2023-01-01');CREATE TABLE orders_2023 PARTITION OF orders  FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2024-01-01');CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');This will create the db schema discussed above. Now let’s put some data to play around. I have used thisscript to put random 1 million rows into database. require 'benchmark'require 'pg'class OrderGenerator BATCH_SIZE = 10_000 TOTAL_RECORDS = 1_000_000 START_DATE = Date. new(2019, 1, 1) END_DATE = Date. new(2024, 12, 31) TOTAL_DAYS = (END_DATE - START_DATE). to_i + 1 def self. generate_orders  conn = PG. connect(dbname: 'your_database_name')  time = Benchmark. measure do   (0. . . TOTAL_RECORDS). each_slice(BATCH_SIZE) do |batch|    values = batch. map do     order_date = random_date     customer_id = rand(1. . 100_000)     amount = rand(10. 0. . 1000. 0). round(2)      (DATE '#{order_date}', #{customer_id}, #{amount})     end. join(',')    sql =  INSERT INTO orders (order_date, customer_id, amount) VALUES #{values}     conn. exec(sql)    print '. ' # Progress indicator   end  end  puts  \nTime taken: #{time. real. round(2)} seconds   puts  Total records inserted: #{conn. exec( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders ). getvalue(0,0)}  ensure  conn. close if conn end def self. random_date  START_DATE + rand(TOTAL_DAYS) endend# Generate ordersOrderGenerator. generate_ordersBOOM! It ran in 4. 2 Seconds. Running queries: Now we have all the setup needed, let’s jump to the exciting part. Finding entries from same year: This would be the query to finding records from the year 2020 from the partitioned table. select * from orders where order_date between '2020-07-11' and '2020-08-11'But how will we assured that it is using partitioned table? Simple, analyze the query. explain analyzeselect * from orders where order_date between '2020-07-11' and '2020-08-11'And the output is - You can see that the data is being pulled from orders_2020 table which confirms partition is working. I amjust wondering if the execution time can be reduced. What can we do? Let’s try putting an index on these tables. Note - For PostgreSQL 11 and later: We can create a global index on the partitioned table, which will automatically propagate to all partitions: CREATE INDEX idx_orders_order_date ON orders (order_date);This single command will create the index on the parent table and all existing and future partitions. Let’s rerun our query and see the result - Wow the time is reduced by 61%. This is just awesome.  Finding entries from different years: Let’s find out records from different years. Query - explain analyzeselect * from orders where order_date between '2020-12-11' and '2021-01-11'And it is executed around 10ms, which is good. Also we can see the Bitmap Heap Scan used by query planner.  Did index made any difference here?: To find out answer to this question, let’s drop the index &amp; run query again - DROP INDEX idx_orders_order_dateexplain analyzeselect * from orders where order_date between '2020-12-11' and '2021-01-11'And no surprise here. The execution time is increased by 4x.  That’s it from this post. I hope this was interesting! "

    "title": "Serializers in Ruby on Rails",
    "body": "2024/07/23 -  When building APIs with Ruby on Rails, serializers play a pivotal role in data transformation and presentation. They serve as the crucial intermediary between your complex Ruby objects and the streamlined JSON (or other formats) that your API serves to clients. This comprehensive guide will delve deep into the world of serializers, exploring their purpose, implementation strategies, advanced techniques, and best practices.  Understanding Serialization in Rails: Serialization, at its core, is the process of converting complex data structures or object states into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, and later reconstructed. In the context of web APIs, this typically involves converting Ruby objects into JSON or XML.  What are Serializers?:  Data Control: Serializers allow precise control over which attributes of an object are exposed in your API.  Relationship Management: They provide a clean way to handle and include associated objects in API responses.  Custom Data Manipulation: Serializers enable the addition of computed properties or custom logic to API responses.  Consistency: They ensure a uniform structure for API responses across your application.  Security: By explicitly defining what’s exposed, serializers help prevent accidental data leaks. Rails’ Built-in Serialization: Before diving into dedicated serializer libraries, it’s worth noting that Rails provides basic serialization out of the box: class User &lt; ApplicationRecord def as_json(options = {})  super(options. merge(only: [:id, :name, :email])) endendWhile functional, this approach can become unwieldy for complex objects or when you need different serialization strategies for the same object.  ActiveModel::Serializer: A Deep Dive: ActiveModel::Serializer (AMS) is the most popular serialization library for Rails. Let’s explore its features and usage in depth. 1. Setting Up ActiveModel::Serializer: Add to your Gemfile: gem 'active_model_serializers', '~&gt; 0. 10. 0'Then run bundle install. 2. Creating and Customizing Serializers: Generate a serializer: rails generate serializer UserThis creates app/serializers/user_serializer. rb. Let’s examine a comprehensive example: class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :name, :email, :full_name, :account_status has_many :posts has_one :profile belongs_to :company def full_name   #{object. first_name} #{object. last_name}  end def account_status  object. active? ? 'Active' : 'Inactive' end def posts  object. posts. published end def include_email?  scope &amp;&amp; scope. admin? endendThis serializer demonstrates several key features:  Basic attribute inclusion Association handling Custom attribute methods Conditional attribute inclusion3. Serializer Inheritance: Serializers can inherit from each other, allowing for DRY code: class BasicUserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :nameendclass DetailedUserSerializer &lt; BasicUserSerializer attributes :email, :created_at has_many :postsend4. Adapter Configuration: AMS supports different adapters for generating JSON. The two main ones are :attributes and :json_api. In config/initializers/active_model_serializers. rb: ActiveModelSerializers. config. adapter = :attributes # or :json_apiThe :json_api adapter follows the JSON:API spec, which provides a standardized way of formatting API responses.  Advanced Serializer Techniques: 1. Nested and Compound Documents: For complex object graphs, you might need nested serializers: class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :name has_many :posts, serializer: PostPreviewSerializer has_one :address, serializer: AddressSerializerendclass PostPreviewSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :title, :excerptendclass AddressSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :street, :city, :countryend 2. Polymorphic Relationships: Handling polymorphic relationships requires special attention: class CommentSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :content belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: trueendclass PostSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :title has_many :comments, serializer: CommentSerializerendclass ImageSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :url has_many :comments, serializer: CommentSerializerend 3. Caching Strategies: Caching can significantly improve performance: class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer cache key: 'user', expires_in: 3. hours attributes :id, :name, :email belongs_to :company has_many :posts def cache_key   user/#{object. id}-#{object. updated_at}  endend 4. Meta Information and Links: Adding meta information and links to your serialized output: class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :name link(:self) { user_url(object) } meta do  {   created_at: object. created_at,   last_login: object. last_login_at  } endend Performance Optimization: 1. N+1 Query Prevention: Avoid N+1 queries by eager loading associations: class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def index  users = User. includes(:posts, :company). all  render json: users endend2. Selective Loading: Load only what you need: class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :name has_many :posts, if: -&gt; { should_include_posts? } def should_include_posts?  @instance_options[:include_posts] endend# In your controllerrender json: @user, include_posts: params[:include_posts]3. Fragment Caching: For parts of your JSON that change less frequently: class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id, :name has_many :posts do  Rails. cache. fetch([ user , object. id,  posts ]) do   object. posts. map { |post| PostSerializer. new(post). as_json }  end endend API Versioning Strategies: 1. Namespace-based Versioning: module API module V1  class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer   attributes :id, :name, :email  end end module V2  class UserSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer   attributes :id, :full_name, :email   def full_name     #{object. first_name} #{object. last_name}    end  end endend2. Accept Header Versioning: Use different serializers based on the Accept header: class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController def show  user = User. find(params[:id])  render json: user, serializer: serializer_for_version end private def serializer_for_version  case request. headers['VERSION']  when 'v1'   API::V1::UserSerializer  when 'v2'   API::V2::UserSerializer  else   API::V1::UserSerializer  end endend Testing Serializers: Thorough testing of serializers is crucial. Here’s an expanded RSpec example: RSpec. describe UserSerializer do let(:user) { create(:user, first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Doe') } let(:serializer) { described_class. new(user) } let(:serialization) { JSON. parse(serializer. to_json) } it  includes the basic attributes  do  expect(serialization). to include(   'id' =&gt; user. id,   'name' =&gt; user. name,   'email' =&gt; user. email  ) end it  includes the full name  do  expect(serialization['full_name']). to eq('John Doe') end it  includes active posts  do  active_post = create(:post, user: user, status: 'published')  inactive_post = create(:post, user: user, status: 'draft')  expect(serialization['posts']). to include(   include('id' =&gt; active_post. id)  )  expect(serialization['posts']). not_to include(   include('id' =&gt; inactive_post. id)  ) end context  when serialized by an admin  do  let(:admin) { create(:user, admin: true) }  let(:serializer) { described_class. new(user, scope: admin) }  it  includes the email  do   expect(serialization). to have_key('email')  end end context  when serialized by a regular user  do  let(:regular_user) { create(:user, admin: false) }  let(:serializer) { described_class. new(user, scope: regular_user) }  it  does not include the email  do   expect(serialization). not_to have_key('email')  end endend Alternative Serialization Approaches: While ActiveModel::Serializer is popular, there are other approaches worth considering: 1. Jbuilder: Jbuilder allows you to build JSON structures with a Ruby DSL: # app/views/users/show. json. jbuilderjson. extract! @user, :id, :name, :emailjson. posts @user. posts do |post| json. extract! post, :id, :titleend2. Fast JSON API: Developed by Netflix, Fast JSON API focuses on performance: class UserSerializer include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer attributes :name, :email has_many :posts attribute :full_name do |object|   #{object. first_name} #{object. last_name}  endend3. Blueprinter: Blueprinter offers a simple, declarative approach to serialization: class UserBlueprint &lt; Blueprinter::Base identifier :id fields :name, :email association :posts, blueprint: PostBlueprint field :full_name do |user|   #{user. first_name} #{user. last_name}  endend Real-world Considerations: 1. Handling Large Datasets: For large datasets, consider pagination and using background jobs for data preparation. 2. Serializer Composition: For complex objects, consider composing serializers: class ComplexObjectSerializer &lt; ActiveModel::Serializer attributes :id has_one :user has_one :product has_many :orders def user  UserSerializer. new(object. user). as_json end def product  ProductSerializer. new(object. product). as_json end def orders  object. orders. map { |order| OrderSerializer. new(order). as_json } endendConclusion: Serializers are a powerful tool in the Rails ecosystem, offering a clean, maintainable way to shape your API responses. They provide a separation of concerns, allowing your models to focus on business logic while serializers handle data presentation. While ActiveModel::Serializer is a popular choice, it’s important to consider your specific needs. For simple APIs or performance-critical applications, you might opt for a lighter solution or even manual JSON construction. However, for most applications, the structure and flexibility that serializers provide make them an excellent choice. As with any tool, the key is to understand the trade-offs and choose the approach that best fits your application’s needs. Whether you’re building a small API or a complex system with multiple client applications, mastering serializers will help you create robust, efficient, and maintainable Rails APIs. "

    "title": "Rails ActiveRecord Concerns",
    "body": "2024/07/21 -  ActiveRecord Concerns are a powerful feature in Ruby on Rails that allow you to extract common code from your models and share it across multiple classes. They provide a clean and modular way to organize your code, promoting the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. In this post, we’ll dive into what Concerns are, how to use them effectively, and some best practices.  What are ActiveRecord Concerns?: Concerns in Rails are modules that extend ActiveSupport::Concern. They allow you to encapsulate related methods, callbacks, and validations into reusable units that can be mixed into multiple models. This is particularly useful when you have functionality that spans across different models but doesn’t warrant a full-blown class inheritance.  Creating a Concern: Let’s create a simple Concern to demonstrate. Imagine we have multiple models that need timestamping functionality: # app/models/concerns/timestampable. rbmodule Timestampable extend ActiveSupport::Concern included do  before_save :set_timestamp end def set_timestamp  self. timestamp = Time. current endend Using a Concern in Models: To use this Concern in a model, you simply include it: class Article &lt; ApplicationRecord include Timestampableendclass Comment &lt; ApplicationRecord include TimestampableendNow both Article and Comment will have the set_timestamp method and the before_save callback.  Advanced Usage: Class Methods and Instance Methods: Concerns can include both instance and class methods: module Searchable extend ActiveSupport::Concern included do  scope :search, -&gt;(query) { where( title LIKE ? ,  %#{query}% ) } end class_methods do  def top_results(limit = 5)   order(views: :desc). limit(limit)  end end def update_search_index  # Logic to update search index endendWhen included in a model, this Concern adds a search scope, a class method top_results, and an instance method update_search_index.  Best Practices for Using Concerns:  Keep Concerns Focused: Each Concern should have a single, well-defined responsibility.  Name Concerns Descriptively: Use names that clearly indicate the functionality, like Searchable, Archivable, or Taggable.  Use included Block Wisely: The included block is executed in the context of the including class, making it perfect for defining callbacks, scopes, and other class-level configurations.  Avoid Deep Nesting: While Concerns can include other Concerns, be cautious about creating deep hierarchies that can become hard to understand.  Document Your Concerns: Especially if they’re used across multiple models, good documentation can save time and prevent confusion. When to Use Concerns vs. Inheritance:  Use Concerns when you have behavior that’s shared across unrelated models.  Use inheritance when you have a clear “is-a” relationship between models. Testing Concerns: Don’t forget to test your Concerns! You can test them in isolation: RSpec. describe Timestampable do let(:dummy_class) { Class. new { include Timestampable } } let(:dummy_instance) { dummy_class. new } it  sets timestamp before save  do  expect(dummy_instance). to receive(:set_timestamp)  dummy_instance. run_callbacks(:save) endend Conclusion: ActiveRecord Concerns are a powerful tool in the Rails developer’s toolkit. They allow for clean, modular, and reusable code across your models. By extracting common functionality into Concerns, you can keep your models lean and focused, while still benefiting from shared behavior where needed. Concerns should be used judiciously. They’re excellent for sharing behavior across unrelated models, but shouldn’t be used as a catch-all for any shared code. When used correctly, they can significantly improve the organization and maintainability of your Rails application. "

    "title": "HAML - Beautifying HTMLs",
    "body": "2024/07/18 -  What?: HAML is HTML Abstract Markup Language. It is developed on one core principle - to beautify markup. But at the same timeit also helps in maintaining DRY, well intended and structured code. Haml markup is similar to CSS in syntax. For example, Haml has the same dot . representation for classes as CSS does. It is around from 2006 and is still actively maintained.  Why?: 1. Reduced repetition aka DRY HTML involves lot of repetition - once at the start and at the end of actual content. ERB also adds some repetition. For example: &lt;p&gt;Example Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;HAML reduces this repetition like - %p Example ParagraphTo make this work HAML relies on indentation. 2. Indented &amp; structured code HAML forces use of strict indentation. The direct benefit of it is more structured code. For example look at this code. The mixture of these qualities make the code beautiful. However defining beautiful code is hard, but as mentioned in HAML documentation it is one of their core principle. 3. Executes ruby code It’s also possible to embed Ruby code into Haml documents. An equals sign, =, will output the result of the code. A hyphen, -, will run the code but not output the result. It also supports control statements like if, while.  How?: To get more out of this article, let’s convert a HTML code block into HAML code. Example 1: HTML - &lt;section class= container &gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= post. title %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= post. subtitle %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class= content &gt;  &lt;%= post. content %&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;HAML - %section. container %h1= post. title %h2= post. subtitle . content  = post. contentExample 2: HTML - &lt;nav class= navbar &gt; &lt;ul class= nav-list &gt;  &lt;li class= nav-item &gt;   &lt;a href= / &gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class= nav-item &gt;   &lt;a href= /about &gt;About&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class= nav-item &gt;   &lt;a href= /services &gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class= nav-item &gt;   &lt;a href= /contact &gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;section class= hero &gt; &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Our Website&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;We provide amazing services to our clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class= about &gt; &lt;h2&gt;About Us&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are a company dedicated to providing the best services in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class= services &gt; &lt;h2&gt;Our Services&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul class= service-list &gt;  &lt;li class= service-item &gt;Consulting&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class= service-item &gt;Development&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li class= service-item &gt;Support&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/section&gt;HAML - %nav. navbar %ul. nav-list  %li. nav-item   %a{ href:  /  } Home  %li. nav-item   %a{ href:  /about  } About  %li. nav-item   %a{ href:  /services  } Services  %li. nav-item   %a{ href:  /contact  } Contact%section. hero %h1 Welcome to Our Website %p We provide amazing services to our clients. %section. about %h2 About Us %p We are a company dedicated to providing the best services in the industry. %section. services %h2 Our Services %ul. service-list  %li. service-item Consulting  %li. service-item Development  %li. service-item SupportDid you noticed the change?

    "title": "Transaction by Example in Rails",
    "body": "2023/10/29 - What is transaction? Transaction is the smallest non-dividable piece of code. It can be described as the entity which we cannot be modularised again into smaller modules such that it will be run in a binary form - either it is executed completely or it is not executed at all. In terms of business logic, transaction can be described as a group of few operations which are necessarily need to be performed together at all cost. Let’s try to understand through an example. In digital banking a transfer of money would be successful only if the money is debited from the sender’s account and same amount of money is credited into receiver’s bank account. The transaction would be incomplete if any of these two statements are not successful. How transactions can be implemented rails?: ActiveRecord has a method called ‘transaction’ which can be called like below space - ActiveRecord::Base. transaction do  {code block}endAs this is an ActiveRecord implementation, it ensures every write or update to the database is either completely committed or none of the database updates are committed. Let's see through an example. : ActiveRecord::Base. transaction do  user = User. first user. update!(status: 1) user. products. update_all(frozen: true) endHere we are trying to update the User and associated Product records in the database and these are wrapped inside a transaction. The console log for this code will be like this - We can see that both the database updates are sucessful. Now,: let’s try to play with transaction block. As we previously mentioned it will either save all changes or will not save any change. Let’s test it. For this use case we will need a code which will throw an error and causes unsuccessful completion of code. We can make use of divide by 0 exception by simply putting a statement without complicating it. Here is how the updated code block will look like - ActiveRecord::Base. transaction do  user = User. first user. update!(status: 0) user. products. update_all(frozen: false) ### will throw ZeroDivisionError foo = 10/0endLet’s try to execute this code block. And here is the result - As you can see from the bottom of the log, this code has thrown divided by zero exception and as a result of which, database has rolled back the transaction. Meaning both the updates first to the users table and second to the products table are not saved to the database. So both the tables users and products are now at the same state they were before running the transaction block. Curious about foo? Variable vs DB save?: What happens to the value of foo? As it is not a database entity but a simple local very able how transaction deals with it? Let’s find out. foo = 1ActiveRecord::Base. transaction do  foo = 2 user = User. first user. update!(status: 0) user. products. update_all(frozen: false) ### will throw ZeroDivisionError foo = 10/0endfooLet’s try to execute this code block. And here is the result - Here you can see the value of food is equal to last update value within the transaction block. Foo has not rolled back its value to pre-transaction block value. By this example we can conclude local variable values are not ruled back even if transaction fails. More on Transactions in Rails -:    Transactions are executed on a single database connection. Managing transaction in a fully distributed system is out of scope of the active record.     They can be called on any Model or an instance of Model object. like -  ### 1. ModelUser. transaction do user = User. first user. update!(status: 0)end### 2. Model instanceuser = User. firstuser. transaction do user. update!(status: 0)end It is not mandatory to update only records from the model which initiated the transaction block but we can also update records from other Models. e. g. -User. transaction do user = User. first user. update!(status: 0) user. picture. update!(title: 'Lorem ipsum')endReferences:  rails repo - activerecord/lib/active_record/"

    "body": "2023/09/08 - self is a keyword in ruby which means it is reserved by Ruby to serve a specific purpose and we cannot use it like regular variables (although you can override it, but you shouldn’t). What is self in Ruby?: Behaviour of self depends on what context it is defined. self can represent instance of class or the class itself. Let’s understand through examples. 1. within method: In this case, self represents the current instance of the class. It will be different for different instances of the class and will not intervene any proceedings between them.

What is libpq?: libpq is a library that helps app to communicate with postgresql backend server. It is C application programmer’s interface. It helps in passing on queries and returning the result. Also: As per Postgresql docs - libpq is also the underlying engine for several other PostgreSQL application interfaces, including those written for C++, Perl, Python, Tcl and ECPG. So some aspects of libpq behavior will be important to you if you use one of those packages. In particular, Section 34. 15, Section 34. 16 and Section 34. 19 describe behavior that is visible to the user of any application that uses libpq. When it is used?: If you have Postgresql on your setup, then libpq will be needed and used as underlying interface to communicate with Postgresql backend server. How to install libpq?:  On Mac OS  brew install libpq    On Ubuntu  sudo apt-get install libpq-dev    Issues if not installed: -&gt; Installation of libpq should resolve this error. If you are still facing an issue, you might need to add libpq to path.

For example, Image can belong to User as well as Product, because user will have self image and product will have descriptive images of product. This can be achieved with Polymorphic associations - Two or more models can be associated to third model using single association. How to use it?: Let’s understand how to use it. There are two parts -  Migration defining two fields on the model which will have work as base model. It will have association_id -&gt; int and association_type -&gt; string.  Defining associations in models. And we are ready to use it. Lets understand through code example. Code Example: Suppose we have three models - Picture, User, Product. We need specify polymorphic association atpictures table creation 1. Migration: We will add two fields imageable_type and imageable_id. 2. Model associations changes: What if we do not use Polymorphic?: We will have to create two tables representing User-Image and Product-Image associations. That will bestoring same attributes in two tables except user_id and product_id. Benefits: The setup provides easy access to associated models.  From an instance of the User model, you can retrieve a collection of pictures: @user. pictures Similarly, you can retrieve @product. pictures If you have an instance of the Picture model, you can get to its parent via @picture. imageable Polymorphic association helps in making your code DRY(Do not Repeat Yourself)Can we test polymorphic associations?: Yes, of course. I am using rspec for unit testing instead of minitest. It can be installed from hereinstall rails rspec. If you had not installed rspec previously, run $ rails generate rspec:model user   create spec/models/user_spec. rb$ rails generate rspec:model product   create spec/models/product_spec. rb$ rails generate rspec:model picture   create spec/models/picture_spec. rbNow we have empty rspec files for models.

Ruby supports inheriting only from one parent class.  So what is the way for inheriting from multiple classes? By the way are you aware of classic diamond problem inmulitple inheritance? If not, read more about it here. Here comes in play modules in Ruby. Modules are somewhat different than classes -  Modules can’t be instantiated, class can be instantiated Can’t create object of Modules, but can create object of class We can include multiple modules in a single class, but can’t include classesTo achieve multiple inheritance, we can include as many modules in a class. The same methods will be overriden by latest implementation. Let’s take a example - Here module A is included in class C and so when method name is called upon class C it results printing  A  Now let’s consider this example - Here we have two modules A and B. And when these two are included in class C, because both define same method name and module B is included after A - the program output is  B  And that’s how we can include multiple modules in same class.

Note - The reason described below is one of the cause, it is quite possible to reproduce this issue due to another reason. Let’s begin. Few days ago, like every normal day I started dev environment rails server and suddenly server log floodedwith error message - early-termination-of-worker. I did not understand at the time why it has happened as I did nothing different. Oh, but there was one thing to note - I had to abruptly shut down mac the day before. Was it even related? Yes, it was! While shutting down mac, postgres server was also abruptly closed - leading to stale postmaster. pid file in thesystem. And the other day when I was trying to start rails server, it was unable to connect to postgres server. The reason was postgres server was unable to start as system had stale postmaster. pid reference. If you are stuck at how I find out the reason, here it is - So after knowing the problem, answer was straight forward - Go and delete postmaster. pid file. How to do it? I use postgres desktop application, so these were steps for me -    Open terminal &amp; navigate to Postgres directory. You can find postgres directory by opening postgres app and clicking on server settings option. My path was - /Users/swapnil/Library/Application Support/Postgres/var-13   List all files in the directory and check if postmaster. pid file is present.   ls -a    Go ahead and remove postmaster. pid -  rm postmaster. pid   . That’s it. After this step your postgres server should be running &amp; so rails server will be able to connect to it. P. S. - If you installed postgres via different method then solution steps would be different for you. Thanks. Cheers! "

Create Application Load Balancer:      Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console. aws. amazon. com/ec2/    On the navigation pane, open CREATE LOAD BALANCER.    Choose Create for Application Load Balancer.    -    Adding listener configuration:   We need to add where load balancer is listening. We also need to specify what action should be taken, but it is coveredlater in the post as it has a pre-requisite task. We will listen from both ports 80 and 443.          For port 443 (HTTPS) - On AWS console, for port choose HTTPS and for port choose 443.           For port 80 (HTTP) - On AWS console, for protocol choose HTTP and for port choose 80.       -    Configure Security Settings:   AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is the preferred tool to provision and store server certificates. If you previously stored a server certificate using IAM, you can deploy it to your load balancer. From Certificate type dropdown choose Choose a certificate from ACM (recommended). Select Certificate from Certificate name dropdown.  -    Adding VPC and security groups:   Add appropriate VPC and security groups to your ALB  -    Adding target group:   Create new target group with protocol (HTTP) and port (80). For health check keep default settings or assign any otherroute your application has, it will be used for periodically checking health of target group. Use this target group toforward your traffic from listener port 443 (From the above steps).   -    Listeners &amp; targets settings:   Open listeners edit option and do changes for following      For port 80 (HTTP) - Open edit option.

For port 443 (HTTPS) - Open edit option. Select protocol HTTPS and port 443. For Default action(s), choose Forward to and then select your ALB target group from the drop-down menu. For Default SSL certificate, choose From ACM(recommended) and then choose the ACM certificate.    -    Already have Application Load Balancer up and running, then     In the navigation pane, choose Load Balancers and then choose your Application Load Balancer.

For Default SSL certificate, choose From ACM (recommended) and then choose the ACM certificate.    Choose Save.    If you are operating classic load balancer, then the process is slightly different. For classic LB, please refer to thisguide - https://aws. amazon. com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/associate-acm-certificate-alb-nlb/ - Note: Make sure to apply proper security groups and subnet configuration to allow traffic only from expected load balancerotherwise EC2 instance would be still accessible via http to end user.

Application performance is a large concept which can be measured with different number of parameters. It also depends on underlying infrastructure. So here we will setup very simple and minimalistic performance dashboard for a Rails application which will help us monitor controller action runtime, database query runtime and view rendering runtime. Let’s start Pre-requisites  influxdb: install unless is_influxdb_installed? grafana: install unless is_grafana_installed? Rails app  Now add gem influxdb-rails gem to Rails application Gemfile and run bundle. To get things up run  bundle exec rails generate influxdb    This will create initialzer config/initializers/influxdb_rails. rb, which allows configuration of this gem.     We need one infuxdb database to store performance time series data, which eventually will be used by grafana dashboard. Open influxdb cosnole by running influx. If you face issue of connection refused, make sure influxd is running.  Once console is accessible create a database. I’m creating database named ‘rails-dev’ for now.   We need to tell our rails application what database it should look for to store data. If it is going to use database service from another instance, we must provide hostname. For all this, open influxdb initializer file. For database name - config. client. database =  rails-dev If you are going to use a hosted influxdb instance then provide its address here For hostname - config. client. hosts = [ host-name. com/8086 ]At this point we are set with storing performance metrics data into influxdb ‘rails-dev’.    Check if grafana installed is working. Open http://localhost:3005. Recheck if port number isappropriate. You can verify port number and other details of grafana from ‘grafana. ini’     Let’s import a simple dashboard in grafana. We will use already created dashboard for the rails app. Navigate to import screen &amp; paste this board id 10428. Grafana will updateconfiguration and import the board. That’s it. Import is pretty simple and straight forward.   Now we are all prepared to see live performance metrics of our application.

This is used to decide next value for primary key column. In most common scenario the column named id holds primary key for the table. When first row is being added, id is set to 1.

Let’s take step by step look into creating a Rails App and making a request for Background job using sidekiq System Pre-requisite  Ruby Rails Redis SidekiqNote: The repository of this project.  Create new Rails Project: We will create a new rails project named sidekiq-example Add sidekiq gem: In Gemfile add gem ‘sidekiq’ gem sidekiq Now run command bundle install. This will install gem sidekiq in our project. ➜ sidekiq-example: bundle install Generate Model: Let’s create a model named Team for reference with fields name, rating Also add this in seeds. rb Now Run ➜ sidekiq-example: rails db:create &amp;&amp; rails db:migrate &amp;&amp; rails db:seed It will create new database sidekiq_example_development for our application and create a table called teams in this database. Running seed data will insert sample 5 records in it.  Generate a controller: Create a controller for our actions under namespace api/v1/  Add routes: Let’s add routes for our actions. Add this in routes. rb.  Add Sidekiq worker: Now let’s work on Sidekiq part. To perform sidekiq jobs, add worker in app/workers. For our demo applicationit is BuyTimeWorker. And add method named perform in it. When a call to BuyTimeWorker made, it will be aasynchronous call to this method perform. The logic for background job will be in this method perform. To keep it simple for now, will just add sleep timer in it.  It simply sleeps for number of milliseconds passed to it. This job will run asynchronously when called. Let’s modify teams controller to make a call to this background job You can see action show is making call to BuyTimeWorker. What it means is when a url of kind '/api/v1/teams/:id'is hit, the controller action show will get called and background job BuyTimeWorker will be triggered. The action showwill not wait for job BuyTimeWorker to complete though it is called from within its definition. This job will be executed asynchronously with method show.  Run:  Start rails server Start Redis Start SidekiqIf you hit URL will found out something like this in sidekiq server log http://localhost:3001/api/v1/teams/2  ):Well this is very simple example of running background job in rails. You can write complex logic in Sidekiq workers. You can add multiple workers. Cheers! 🍻🍻 "

    "body": "2019/11/22 - Q: Do we need to run rails db:seed, rails db:migrate every time the deployment happen? Ans - Absolutely no. rails db:seed should only run for the first time i. e. first deployment. But migrations shouldbe run on every deployments. So here is what we need - Run seed data only for first deployment. We will consider here containerised architecture. Here are steps - During deployment  Check if db exists If yes, then run rails db:migrate If no, then run rails db:create &amp;&amp; rails db:migrate &amp;&amp; rails db:seed How to determine if db exists during deployment? : Ans - After some googling, found out that a rake task can be written to determine if db exists   namespace :db do   desc  Checks to see if the database exists    task :exists do    begin     Rake::Task['environment']. invoke     ActiveRecord::Base. connection    rescue     exit 1    else     exit 0    end   end  end  This task tries to establish connection with the database, if exception occurs then return with exit 1. Exceptionoccurred, here, means the database does not exists. And no exception means connection established successfully andreturn with exit 0. To summarise,   if db does not exists then exit 1  if db exists then exit 0 Run seed data if db:exists, How? : Ans - In deployment script, the conditional bash logic can be executed like args: [  -c ,  env &amp;&amp; bundle exec rake db:exists; DB_EXISTS=$?; [[ $DB_EXISTS = 1 ]] &amp;&amp; (rails db:create db:migrate db:seed) || (rails db:migrate)  ]bundle exec rake db:exists; DB_EXISTS=$?; [[ $DB_EXISTS = 1 ]] &amp;&amp; (rails db:create db:migrate db:seed) || (rails db:migrate) This makes call to rake task above. Then collects its output into a variable DB_EXISTS. Then check if value of DB_EXISTS is equal to 1(which means db does notexists, according to our above assessment), IF YES THEN RUN rails db:create db:migrate db:seed, ELSE run rails db:migrate.

    "title": "Scopes in Rails",
    "body": "2019/07/11 - Recently I was calling create method on an active-record model object. But it failed in validation, because the provided foreign_key_id was not present in the associated table. My first guess was it might be a dangling reference. But I was wrong. There was a record with this foreign_key_id in its table. So what went wrong? It was a problem with default scope defined on an associated model. Let’s first understand how scopes work in Rails. When we define a scope on an ActiveRecord model  class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  scope :red, -&gt; { where(color: 'red') } enda class method is added to the Model. It is simply like this  class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  def self. red   where(color:'red')  end endThat means instead of querying Vehicle. where(color:'red'), we would be simply doing  Vehicle. redThe object returned by scope is always an ActiveRecord::Relation not Array. And this is the greatest benefit, because you can call allthe queries on this object just like any other Relation object.  Vehicle. red Vehicle. red. count Vehicle. red. where(type: 'Hatchback')You should always pass a callable object to the scopes defined with #scope. This ensures that the scope is re-evaluated eachtime it is called. . Default Scope: What if we need to query Vehicle model with some pre-fixed parameters. Suppose requirement is to show vehicles of drive type ‘Gear’ only. We must add the where(drive_type: 'Gear') clause to all the requests. Is there a better way with scopes? Yes!! Just by defining default scope we would be able to query the drive_type geared vehicles only. Just like  class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  default_scope {where(drive_type: 'gear')} endThis will add where(drive_type: 'gear') to all the request we make to Vehicle. This is just one way to use default scope. You can use default scopes n number of times in a Model. They all will beclub together in the resulting query.  class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  default_scope {where(drive_type: 'gear')}  default_scope {where(color: 'red')} endIn this way we are able to filter each request on Model with default scope. . . Unscoped: As much as we need default scope, we may also need to undo it at some places. It means calling a plain query on a Model without any pre-defined clause/s. It can be just like  Vehicle. unscoped. countIt will result Vehicle. count by removing default clause where(drive_type: 'gear') … How associations work with Scopes: Scopes have effect on associated classes. The default scopewill take effect when a parent class makes query to the associated class. Just like  class Klass &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  has_many :vehicles end class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :klass  default_scope {where(drive_type: 'gear')} endWhen a query is made from klass object to vehicles, the default scope  drive_type: 'gear' will be auto considered. …. Extended Scopes: Scopes can be extended to have methods defined within themselves. Suppose  class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  scope :geared, -&gt; {where(drive_type: 'gear')} do   def count    count   end      def pluck_ids    pluck(:id)   end endCalling Vehicle. geared. count would be equivalent to Vehicle. where(drive_type: 'gear'). count and likewise for pluck_ids. … Why not class methods?: From all the discussion about scopes, you might think why not use class methods instead? And yes it is absolutely fine to chooseclass methods over scopes. The only problem I see for now is the difference between how we handle the chain-ability of relations. For instance, consider  #Scopes class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  scope :color, -&gt; color { where(color: color) }  scope :gear, -&gt; { where(drive_type: 'gear') } end #Class method class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  def self. color(color)   where(color: color)  end    def self. gear   where(drive_type: 'gear')  end endWhen we call Vehicle. color('red'). gear, it would absolutely work. But for Vehicle. color(''). gear we won’t get any result,because the argument passed to color is blank. And it won’t be a desired output. If argument is nil or blank we would want to getall result instead. And will do this like  #Scopes class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  scope :color, -&gt; color { where(color: color) if color. present? } end #Class method class Vehicle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  def self. color(color)   if color. present?    where(color: color)   else    all   end  end endIt is upto you what to choose. But I think we should consider what framework has to offer before re-inventing the wheel. … Edge case: Let’s assume data for more clear picture state_id is present in every cities record. And State model has a default scope on column_1 as where(column_1: 1).  class State &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  scope :one, -&gt; { where(column_1: 1) }  has_many :cities end class City &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :state endTo insert {name:'New York', state_id: 1} into cities, record with id 1 must exist in states table. But what if states id1 has column_1 set to 2 or any value other than 1. Will the default scope neglect them? Absolutely Yes!! The insertion query will fail with error message ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: State must exist. Then, what is the solution?  class State &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  scope :one, -&gt; { where(column_1: 1) }  has_many :cities end class City &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :state, -&gt;{where(column_1: [1, 2, 3])} endDefining allowed column_1 values in the association itself will do the trick.

Let’s see how string comparison is done by Rails community inside Rails core code. There is a class in place called StringInquirer. Wrapping a string in this class gives you a prettier way to test for equality. The value returned by Rails. env is wrapped in a StringInquirer object, so instead of calling this: Rails. env == 'production'you can call this: Rails. env. production?Instantiating a new StringInquirer user = ActiveSupport::StringInquirer. new('admin')user. admin?  # =&gt; trueuser. admin? # =&gt; falseCheers!

Breakdown of request flow -  Browser generates HTTP/HTTPS request after a click or a event Web server receives request, analyses it and passes to application server Application server calls up proper controller-action after talking with router The resulted output is sent back to browser and displayed on screen.  Web Browser : Browser should direct request to a specific destination. For users it is a URL seen on web page, but computers need IP addresses, they do not understand these URLs. For this purpose, there is a system in place called Domain Name System(DNS) which maps URLs to computer understandable IP addresses. It is browser who starts finding out IP address. Search begins from local cache, of both browser and computer. If local cache does not have IP address of requested site, browser generally asks Internet Service Providers(ISP). If not found then it goes up the hierarchy LIKE Root DNS –&gt; Extension wise Name Servers(like . com, . net, . org) –&gt; And then to Authoritative DNS Server. The chase ends here. Yay! We get the required ip address. Authoritative DNS Server must have IP address for requested site, if not there are high chances that your domain name provider has not set up your domain information properly. It is actually interesting to try on terminal with dig, . .  Web Server : By now browser is successfully connected to server. The server here is web server. Some examples are Apache,Nginx, Passenger, Puma, Unicorn, Webrick. These servers are meant to talk only in http. Their job is to understand the request and make decision on how to sevice that request. For simpler request, we can configure web server easily. Suppose we need to tell web server that if browser asks for any assets then serve it from ‘/public/assets’ folder. There are a list of different web servers you can use for this purpose. With nginx it is like Okay then. We are set to serve requests for assets. If browser asks for assets it will receive an expected response in output,for anything else than assets, it will get 404 not found response. But what if browser asks for latest 10 blog posts from xyz author with some amazing styling and javascript?? Our current configuration does not support this kind of request. Even if we decide to handle it at this level, it will be complex to put it in web server configuration file. So what next? There comes Rails! Web server passes request to Rails application. But there can be many ways for web server to do it. Just to understand, it can call a method with argument or declare variables or use global variables. Even if we managed this, another question arises, in what format should Rails sends data back to web server? To reduce this confusion, there is a system in place called RACK . . . RACK App: Rack is a simple Ruby protocol/convention that does a few things. The web server needs to tell the web framework, “Hey, here a request for you to handle. By the way, here are the deets for the request: paths, http verb, headers, etc. ” On the other hand, the framework needs to tell the server, “Hey, that’s cool, I’ve handled it. Here is the result… the status code, headers, and body. ” In order to remain lightweight and framework agnostic, Rack picked the simplest possible way to do this in Ruby. It notifies the web framework using a method call, communicates the details as method arguments, and the web framework communicates back by return values from the method call. In code it just looks like Web server creates env hash to pass it to Rack’s call method. This env hash has information like http_verb, http_method, parameters, rack_app_version, etc. And the call method responds in three variables - status, header and body. Status is http status, to tell about request completedsuccessfully or whatever happened with it. Headers is a hash of http headers, and Body is an array of response. Coming to rails, the config. ru file will look something like It is supposed to pass Rack application to run keyword, this means Rails. application is a Rack app and must respond to call method. . . . . Our app: Finally request reaches our app. It is evaluated by again a Rack app generated by Rails using routes. rb!!! Yes that’s too muck Rack apps around. But Rails is always been that. config/routes. rb - This will ultimately generate these seven routes From here, most of us know how it works. If request is for '/books' and is of kind GET, it will go to BooksController#index action. Request GET for '/books/:id' will go to BooksController#show and likewise! That’s it from the Rails Request Lifecycle.  Cheers!!!   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.  "

    "title": "How Indexes on database works!",
    "body": "2018/06/08 - When it comes to performance of an application, databases are highly important and effective. And one of the key factor in database optimisation is index. It helps in getting results faster for select and where queries.  What is Index ?: Index is simply a data-structure that holds pointer to rows that has value for a column. It narrows down the number of rows to look out for. Indexes can be created using one of the B-tree, Hash, GiST, GIN.  Comparison of B-tree/Hash/Gist (Generalised Search Tree) /GIN (Generalised Inverted Index)Skip this if you know B-tree and Hash comparison. Most commonly index are created using B-tree, because they are very efficient in time complexity. As well B-tree can handle equality and range queries i. e. &lt;, ≤, &gt;, ≥ operations. B-tree can also sort data in it. Hash indexes can only handle equality(=) operations. Use of Hash index is discouraged by postgresql due to some issues. Hash index operations are not presently WAL-logged, so hash indexes might need to be rebuilt with REINDEX after a database crash if there were unwritten changes. Also, changes to hash indexes are not replicated over streaming or file-based replication after the initial base backup, so they give wrong answers to queries that subsequently use them. For these reasons, hash index use is presently discouraged.    Syntax for Creating index     CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2, . . );   How Index works ?: Suppose we have a users table(id, name) indexed on name. When a record is inserted in users table, respective entry in B-tree would be made. At the moment users table have entries (1, ‘Deepak’), (2, ‘Rohit’), (3, ‘MSD’), (4, ‘Aaradhya’). The indexed B-tree would look like [Aaradhya, Deepak, MSD, Rohit].  For instance, I insert a record (5, ‘Swapnil’), B-tree would be updated to [Aaradhya, Deepak, MSD, Rohit] and node Rohit will point to [Rohit, Swapnil]. The searching operation are made easy because the data is sorted. If you are interested in postgresql code, take a look here on how postgresql works. When search query for name Swapnil is fired, unlike sequentially traversing users table as in without indexing, B-tree will efficiently find it is in node Rohit. Note that after locating node, it switches to binary search to reach Swapnil. Here is the source code to search value in single B-tree in postgresql.  A take on insert/update with index: Insert is the only operation which do not directly benefits from index, as it do not include where clause. Additionally it increases time for inserting. Let’s take a look. When not using index, a database insert operation would only add a row to table. But while using index, it additionally needs to add index-entry in B-tree. And it takes time, first to lookup appropriate node, assign value to node then to maintain B-tree split the node, if needed. In update query, when record is updated in database, the index for the same also gets updated. Building indexes concurrently: Most database systems allow to perform reads while creating index in a single scan, but lock parallel write operations. Transactions involving insert, update, delete will be blocked until index build is finished. And this could have sever impact if system is a live production database. Postgresql supports building indexes without locking with CONCURRENTLY option of CREATE INDEX. It performs two scans of table. First index is entered in system catalog in one transaction. Then two transactions perform two scans. Before each table scan, the index build must wait for existing transactions that have modified the table to terminate. After the second scan, the index build must wait for any transactions that have a snapshot predating the second scan to terminate. When these write operations are done, both scans complete and assures updated data. The reads were never a problem. Read more CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_name ON table_name (column1, column2, . . ); Unique Indexes: A unique index guarantees that the table doesn’t have more than one row with the same value. It’s advantageous to create unique indexes for two reasons: data integrity and performance. Lookups on a unique index are very fast. Note - In terms of data integrity, using a validates_uniqueness_of validation on an ActiveModel class doesn’t really guarantee uniqueness because there can and are concurrent users creating invalid records. Therefore, always create the constraint at the database level - either with an index or a unique constraint. Last Stop:  Indexes does not store values of columns other than indexed ones.  Indexes should be created on columns which are queried frequently.  To optimise insert performance, it is very important to keep the number of indexes small. Have a great day! Cheers!!! "

    "title": "APIs in Rails 5.0 - overview",
    "body": "2018/03/23 - Have you ever wonder how APIs work in the world of convention over configuration, specifically in Rails 5. 0? Rails keeps continuing its legacy of convention over configuration in APIs also. Before Rails 5, we used to use rails-api to implement APIs. But now rails-api is merged to core Rails. So Rails 5 has in-built support for APIs. That’s great!!! Web app or API appIn normal rails web app, there are two parts. One part retrieves data to be served, and other part renders that data into HTML, CSS to see a beautiful webpage. And to note, both the parts are done by Rails itself. But in case of APIs, rails will only be responsible for retrieving data ( it will return data in JSON, XML, etc formats as output ) and the rendering will be performed by other framework like AngularJs, etc or it is just out of scope of rails. What is different in API mode?The major difference in API mode would be, to cut down the needed setup to a very minimal. It would not generate views, helpers and assets. Basically, API mode removes functionality that you do not need. If you start building API server first Rails app, this will do three main things for you -    Configure your application to start with a more limited set of middleware than normal. Specifically, it will not include any middleware primarily useful for browser applications (like cookies support) by default.     Make ApplicationController inherit from ActionController::API instead of ActionController::Base. As with middleware, this will leave out any Action Controller modules that provide functionalities primarily used by browser applications.     Configure the generators to skip generating views, helpers and assets when you generate a new resource.  That’s it! A short introduction on Rails APIs.

    "title": "Rails Includes vs Joins",
    "body": "2018/03/08 - When I started learning Rails, I was always in a state of confusion about using includes or joins,because both are used in almost same scenario. Includes uses eager loading whereas joins uses lazy loading. Both are used when certain operations are meant to be performed on associated tables. And here comes the difference. What is the problem with Joins?: Here, we retrieved users in the first line and data is formatted in the each do loop. Here is interesting thing, to retrieve user. company. name, each time a call to database is made. It means, if there are 10k users then 10k separate queries would be fired up. And this will overkill system when scaled up. Isn’t there is efficient way? Yes, it is Includes. And this will overkill system when scaled up. Isn’t there a more efficient way? Yes, it is Includes. INCLUDES: If we go through Rails documenting, it clearly says - ’With includes, Active Record ensures that all of thespecified associations are loaded using the minimum possible number of queries’. When we need data to be usedfrom associated tables, includes must be used. Here is an example, Here, the data from table companies is brought right in the first line, since it says includes companies. No additional query is fired from the do loop for ‘user. company. name’. Size of users table does not matter now. It is scalable to any size. Isn’t it fantastic? Yes, it is. It saves hell lot of time. And it proves to be very efficient, when applicationcontains huge data.  So, does includes always preferred over joins?Hopefully not, there are some cases when includes does not exceed joins in terms of efficiency. Here, we used tables users and companies, but companies is only for some sort of filter. We did not actually used data from companies later in the code. So no need to bring data from companies along with users. This is why join is efficient in this case. … Eager Loading: It joins everything in a single query. Sometimes the query may result in a huge sql call with too many joins left joins. User. eager_load(:posts) … Pre Loading: Preload works in same way as Includes. It brings up the data normally in two queries. User. pre_load(:posts)–&gt; SELECT  users . * FROM  users  SELECT  posts . * FROM  posts  WHERE  posts .  user_id  IN (1) Cheers!!! "

Here are some findings,  Why Ruby?Ruby provides large, rich set of features, is less syntactic than Java. It is created with developers in mind, to make developers happy.  Convention over configurationRails prefers convention over configuration. You will build application in very less time, if continued with the standard rails follows. e. g. For User model, a table users will be created in database, unless you wish to change it some other name.  Easy to LearnIf you know any programming language (like C, C++, Java, C#, Python), then you will find ruby very easy to understand.  Great CommunityRails has large number of committers who make sure it is in top condition. Many projects goes down with age, but rails has grown vast due to great community support.  Compatibility with latest technologiesRails now can be used with any JS library, such as react. It also works with Angular JS. Rails community has maintained its compatibility with latest tech changes. …  NotesTo build a good product, one should choose a proven, reliable and community supported framework.
